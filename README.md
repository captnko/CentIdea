# CentIdea

I (we) would like to build(invent) an Android app to run Docker on Android(without requiring root etc).

Not sure it's feasible, but the long term idea is to leverage it to run Kubernetes clusters distributed among mobile devices.

Had some experience with both Android development and Kubernetes management.

Any help is more than welcome and appreciated.

We are planning to use Android Studio+GitHub for now

F.A.Q.

Why CentIdea?

Because it could be an idea that is worth a cent or a century idea, you never know!

Why GitHub?

Don't know, any suggestion about alternatives(e.g. gitlab etc) are more than welcome
